Title: A Versatile School Project - Daily Sales and Profit Calculator for computer shop in C++

# Introduction:

The rapid advancement of technology significantly affects our lives, including the field of education.
It is now common for students to be assigned projects that involve computer programming, as it equips them
with essential skills for their future careers.
One such project is creating a console application that manages daily sales of computers, calculates the remaining computers in stock,
and computes the daily profit. This simple yet effective project demonstrates not only the student's ability to develop a helpful tool
but also the power of programming languages in solving real-world problems.

# Description:

The project, developed using C++ programming language, revolves around a console application that serves as a platform
for managing daily sales of computers, maintaining the remaining stock, and computing the daily profit.
Leveraging the robustness of C++, this application incorporates four libraries and utilizes class inheritance to perform the desired operations.
Additionally, the program saves the sales history in a file so that users can review past transactions.

# Key Features:

1. Save daily sales: The primary function of this application is to record daily sales of computers.
Users can input relevant data regarding the model, quantity, and price of computers, which will seamlessly be stored in the application.

2. Calculate remaining stock: The program allows users to check the current inventory status with ease.
By keeping track of the remaining computers after each sale, the application ensures that the user has an updated overview of their stock at any time.

3. Compute daily profit: A crucial aspect of any business is keeping track of profits.
This application simplifies this process by automatically calculating the daily profit based on the price and quantity details provided by the user.

4. Class inheritance: By utilizing class inheritance, the application effectively organizes the functionality and data related to the different types
of computers. This simplifies the code and promotes better understanding, resulting in a more maintainable application.

5. History file: Another prominent feature of this project is that it saves the sales history in a dedicated file, making it convenient for the user
to access and analyze the previous transactions at any time.

# Conclusion:

In conclusion,The console application, equipped with features such as daily sales recording, remaining stock calculation,
and daily profit computation, proves to be a valuable tool for managing computer sales. Furthermore, the use of class inheritance and external
libraries enhances the effectiveness of the application and lays a strong foundation for potential improvements and expansions.
